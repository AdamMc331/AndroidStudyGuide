    <!-- This is a magic hex code found using the color picker app on Mac. This is because
    the material design system
    is doing some manipulation to color a bottom nav when using dark theme. This hex code is designed
    so that the bottom navigation will have the same color as the navigation bar, creating a
    seamless edge to edge experience. -->
