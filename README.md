# Android Study Guide

This project is going to be built live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/adammc331) to demonstrate how to build an Android app from start to finish. Everyone is welcome, but this project may be easiest to follow if you have some existing Android development experience.

If you are confused at any time about this project, create an [issue](https://github.com/AdamMc331/AndroidStudyGuide/issues), ask a question on stream, or even submit one anonymously on Sli.do (will update link) and I will try to answer it during the next broadcast. 

You can find all of the recordings in [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeJI6UYqZX0IppqVFXBleKoRgLExOC19T)!

For a recap of every stream and resources for each one, check out the [Stream History](/StreamHistory.md) page.
